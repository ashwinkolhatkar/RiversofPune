<p>Two imaginary lines exist in the river floodplain &mdash; the blue line and the red line. The blue line marks a &lsquo;once in 25 years&rsquo; floodline, while the red line means &lsquo;once in 100 years&rsquo;. &ldquo;No construction should happen inside the blue line, while a controlled construction is allowed inside the red line. However, these rules are often not followed. People fall prey to illegal construction projects near water bodies and suffer,&rdquo; said Aditi Deodhar, director of Jeevitnadi &mdash; a city-based organisation that works towards river and river-related issues.</p>
<p>In order to raise awareness about the significance of these floodlines, Jeevitnadi recently organised an event titled &lsquo;Respect the Code Red&rsquo; at Baba Bhide Bridge near Deccan Gymkhana. Nearly 200 people, including college and school students, cummins employees and locals, had participated in the event. The programme began with an unusual &lsquo;kirtan&rsquo;, where kirtankar Vishwas Kulkarni touched upon the challenges faced by the rivers and emphasised upon our responsibilities as citizens. Through his musical narration, he also explained the concept of the red and blue floodlines and what could be the result if they are not respected.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Revenue Department define and demarcate extent of the Rivers?</strong></p>
<p>The Revenue Department defines the River&rsquo;s extent based on land ownership information. They distinguish between plots of land and riverbed land using cadastral records. Cadastral records comprise of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) cadastral maps which show shape and location of plots.</p>
<p>2) ownership cadasters which records plot size and the name of the owner.</p>
<p>Information for cadastral maps was originally collated by surveying the extent of plots as defined by boundary wall, fences, etc. on the ground. At the time when such surveys were carried out, land within a river channel that was not customarily &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by anyone (say, because it was prone to periodic flooding or was unclaimed for other reasons) and was designated as being riverbed land. The extent of the river according to Revenue Department maps is based on this customary understanding of what constituted the riverbed at that time when the original survey was undertaken. Therefore, where revision surveys have not been conducted, Revenue maps reflect a historic situation.</p>
<p><strong>What are the problems associated with using maps produced by Revenue Department to define River&rsquo;s extents?</strong></p>
<p>Cadastral maps were originally created for collecting agricultural revenue. Mapping technology was primitive at that time. As a consequence Revenue Maps are cartographically inaccurate. Information for ownership cadasters is usually more up to date.</p>
<p>Since Revenue Department&rsquo;s cadastral maps are the basis for legally determining ownership of land, they exert much legal force, even though the extent of plots and riverbed land as demarcated in them are cartographically inaccurate.</p>
<p>Thus, despite the River extent demarcated in Revenue maps carries much legal force there is nothing &lsquo;natural&rsquo; about the demarcation.</p>
<p><strong>How much land is included within the &lsquo;red&rsquo; and &lsquo;blue&rsquo; lined inundation areas?</strong></p>
<p>The Irrigation Department has delineated the red and blue lines on a topographic survey of the Pune region. This map indicates the administrative boundaries of Pune Municipal Corporation, but, it neither has cadastral information nor does it show the extent of development in the Pune region. As a result it is not possible to unequivocally answer the above question based on the official maps of the Irrigation Department.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to overlay the &lsquo;red&rsquo; and &lsquo;blue&rsquo; lines, the administrative boundaries of the PMC and some cadastral information, on a satellite map. Since the satellite picture also shows the extent of development it is possible to give a fairly accurate answers to the above question. The findings from the overlay exercise that has been undertaken for the Pune Riverfront Project shows that there is a significant amount of land within red line and blue line as shown. However it will be accurately calculated on the basis of latest cadastral map to be prepared for this project.</p>
<p><strong>Who owns the land within the red lined inundation area?</strong></p>
<p>Based on the cadastral information that has been plotted on the satellite map up to now, it is not possible to distinguish between publicly and privately owned plots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is the land included within the red and blue lined inundation areas free of development?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>No, the land included within red and blue lines inundation areas are not free of development. Approximately 46% of the total land designated as plots is developed, while the rest remains vacant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What risks do the development within the red and blue lined inundation areas face?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various ruling of Courts and the National Green Tribunal have prohibited all construction in the area between the blue lines and restricted development in&nbsp;the area between the red lines. Thus the development within the red and blue&nbsp;line exists in an area where development is not allowed and hence faces the risks related to the same. Also as explained in the points above, all the plots lying within the red and blue lined areas are vulnerable to the highest flood expected during any 100-year period, based on the current ground conditions.</p>
