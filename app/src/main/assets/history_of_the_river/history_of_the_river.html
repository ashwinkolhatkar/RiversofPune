<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>History of Pune's Rivers</strong></h2>
<p>The river Mutha, lovingly called 'Muthai'--meaning 'mother Mutha' in Marathi--is dying a slow
    death thanks to rapidly urbanising Pune which is depositing huge amounts of untreated sewage and
    dirt in its waters. However, the situation was different earlier. The river was revered and was
    a part of the everyday lives of the people in the city.</p>
<p>"Do you know the age of the Mutha river?", ask Manish Ghorpade and Anuradha Kodilkar who are
    conducting a walk as a part of the Muthai River Walk initiative organised by Janwani and
    Jeevitnadi.</p>
<p>The walk starts&nbsp;from the Siddheshwar ghats every Sunday morning, with the aim of connecting
    the people of Pune to their very own river, now forgotten and in a very sad state.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"How can you hear the cries of the river unless you go and see it, understand her
    historical connect to Pune and the everyday lives of the people?"</strong>, ask the hosts before
    they take us through the origin, history and the development of the city and the river.</p>
<p>The Sahaydri mountain ranges from which the river originates is one of the oldest, and the Mutha
    river is known to be older than the Ganga. The geological age of the river can thus be traced to
    around 1 lakh years! Geological evidence shows that the banks of the river were covered by lush
    green, dense forests and were home to elephants, aurochs, and ostriches as fossilised remains of
    bones and ostrich eggs have been found near the river banks.</p>
<p>The river banks provided an ideal place for the gradual change from the hunter gatherer phase to
    the agricultural phase. The silt deposited from the river provided a rich ground for the
    agricultural food chain, and fish, amphibians, herbivores, carnivores, all flourished along with
    humans on the banks of this river.</p>
<p>The city of Pune gradually developed as well. There were fourteen ghats on the river where people
    bathed and prayed. As the population of the city began to increase, attempts were made to
    explore other sources of water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lakes such as the Katraj were constructed near the outskirts of the city and water from the lake
    was supplied through underground channels. This led to the gradual expansion of the city away
    from the river. But then, people were still connected to the river as it was associated with
    their everyday lives. However, this was to change as the city grew, as industries came up, and
    dams were built to take care of the water needs.&nbsp;</p>
