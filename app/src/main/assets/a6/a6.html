<h1 align="center"><strong>RIVERS FROM PUNE CARRY MOST POLLUTED WATER: MPCB</strong></h1>
<p>Out of the 744 million litres per day (MLD) of waste generated by Pune through sewage and other
    means, 177 MLD of waste is entering the rivers without treatment. During the past few years,
    industrial units in the vicinity of Pune have been dumping untreated waste into the river,
    destroying the quality of water. When a recent survey carried out by the Maharashtra Pollution
    Control Board (MPCB) found that rivers from Pune carry polluted water, environmentalists were
    not surprised. The MPCB in its recent report has categorised the water quality of rivers flowing
    through Pune district as &ldquo;bad or very bad&rdquo;. According to MPCB officials, besides
    industrial waste, domestic waste is also creating pollution in the rivers.</p>

<p>Out of the 744 million litres per day (MLD) of waste generated by Pune through sewage and other
    means, 177 MLD of waste is entering the rivers without treatment. For the past few years,
    residents of Indapur Taluka in Pune district have been facing a dual crisis. On one hand they
    have been receiving inadequate rainfall with the water level of Ujani dam dipping which provides
    water in the region, on the other hand toxic contents present in the water have caused several
    ailments among the locals.</p>
<p>Besides MPCB, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Pune based Dr Mangesh Kashyap,
    professor Sandeep Joshi, water technologist Sachin Barve and researcher Kiran Joshi in their
    recently conducted study, carried out separately, found high levels of Chemical Oxygen Demand
    (COD) and Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in rivers flowing through the district.</p>
<p>Among the rivers that have bad quality of water are Mutha, Pavana, Indrayani and Bhima, all part
    of the Bhima basin. The Bhima river which brings water into Ujani is one of 49 rivers in the
    state, whose stretches are found to have high amount of pollutants, according to the report from
    the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The CPCB through its 156 monitoring units installed
    at different locations across the 49 rivers found that samples from 153 locations did not meet
    water quality criterion.</p>
<p>The main culprits are the industrial units dumping untreated affluent in the rivers. Taking
    cognisance of this, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has issued show cause notices
    to 5,308 industries and construction units between 2011 to 2017. Of the 5,308 entities which
    include industries and contractions sites, around 2,392 (45%) are from Pune region followed by
    Kolhapur 673 and Navi Mumbai 476.</p>
