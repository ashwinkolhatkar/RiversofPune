<h1 align="center"><strong>STEPS TO ENSURE RIVER CLEANLINESS</strong></h1>
<p>Out on vacation, everyone loves sending a picture postcard of a pristine mountain lake. But most
    of the country&rsquo;s lakes aren&rsquo;t in picture postcard condition. Forty-six percent are
    polluted to the point where they&rsquo;re unsafe for fishing, swimming or supporting normal
    aquatic life. The story&rsquo;s just about the same for our rivers: 40 percent are polluted and
    unsafe for fishing, swimming or aquatic life. That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that
    everyone&mdash;even those of us who aren&rsquo;t living on lake front or river front property&mdash;can
    do things that improve our water quality.All you need to do is follow these 7 ways to help keep
    lakes and rivers clean and pollutant free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use less water One of the biggest threats to water quality comes from aging infrastructure.
    Cities across the nation are dealing with sewer systems that are literally falling apart. In
    some places, these systems date back to the time of the Civil War. Every time you flush your
    toilet or leave the water running while you&rsquo;re brushing your teeth, it increases the load
    on your sewer system. Conserve water. It also lowers the burden on sewage treatment plants.</p>
<p>2. Keep your car repaired We all see those oil spots on driveways and parking lots. When oil
    leaks from our cars it is eventually sent down storm drains and ends up in the watershed. If
    your car has sprung an oil leak, get it fixed. Also, be careful while adding oil and make sure
    any used oil is properly recycled.</p>
<p>3. Use organic gardening techniques In the same way that dripping automotive oil ends up in the
    watershed, so does a large amount of the fertilizers and pesticides you use in your garden. This
    causes rivers and lakes to get a huge dose of nitrogen which makes algae grow abnormally. The
    chemistry of our freshwater lakes and streams gets totally out of whack and fish kills are
    common, along with a host of other problems. Go with natural fertilizers and bug killers and
    even then, stick to the directions and make sure you aren&rsquo;t overusing or applying on days
    when they are likely to be quickly washed away by rain.</p>
<p>4. Compost and contain yard waste Sending bushels of grass clippings down the storm drain isn&rsquo;t
    all that unlike dumping fertilizer down the drain. Nature hasn&rsquo;t designed rivers to be
    suburbia&rsquo;s yard waste receptacle. Too much organic material clogs streams and when it
    breaks down, it can upset up the water chemistry. Compost yard waste and make sure it&rsquo;s in
    bins so it doesn&rsquo;t wash away during a heavy rain.</p>
<p>5. Deal with household chemicals and medicines properly Your local environmental health agency,
    garbage hauler or solid waste department probably has drop-off locations or specially scheduled
    pickups for toxic household chemicals, like solvents, motor oil and paint. Do a little research
    and plug into the system. Also, don&rsquo;t flush unused medicines down the toilet. These are
    starting to turn up in local drinking water supplies. Find the best way to dispose of them
    locally. Also, use natural cleaning products around the house.</p>
<p>6. Go sustainable Individuals can accomplish a lot by doing their personal best to keep our
    rivers and lakes clean and pollutant free, however, the biggest problems are with industry and
    agriculture. Frequent your local farmer&rsquo;s market and find organic farmers. Doing business
    with them helps keep fertilizers and pesticides out of the environment and it also reduces the
    need to truck food over long distances, which reduces all the pollution associated with
    transportation. Also, many areas are allowing households to buy their electricity from
    sustainable sources. If you live in an area where the utilities burn coal, switch to a green
    energy supplier. It will reduce acid rain, which is one of our biggest problems.</p>
<p>7. Don&rsquo;t litter Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have to remind folks not to litter, but still
    some people haven&rsquo;t gotten the message. Go to any river or lake popular with fishermen and
    you&rsquo;ll find plastic wrappers from lures and bait at the water&rsquo;s edge. And, if you
    litter in your neighborhood, it will make its way to a storm drain and get into our streams,
    lakes and eventually into the ocean. Finally, why not take it a step further and volunteer for a
    river or lake cleanup day project?</p>
