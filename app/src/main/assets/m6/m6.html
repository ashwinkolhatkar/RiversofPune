<h1 align="center"><strong>PUNE RIVER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</strong></h1>
<p><strong>What does the Pune River Development Project propose to do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Build Embankments for flood protection</strong></p>
<p>The project proposes to protect low-lying areas along the River from flooding by building a variety of well-modulated embankments along the banks of Pune&rsquo;s Rivers. In sparsely developed areas, further away from the city center, &lsquo;rural riparian embankments&rsquo; will be built. In moderately developed areas &lsquo;urban riparian embankments will be built. In intensely developed area with high banks, more engineered embankments will be built. The embankments on either side of the river will be designed to contain floods between them &ndash; bringing the red and blue lines within the riverbed as defined in Revenue maps.</p>
<p><strong>B. Reduce the impact of man-made obstructions to the flow of water in the river</strong></p>
<p>The Pune River Development Project&rsquo;s first concern is to address the threat of flooding in city. It recognizes that a considerable portion of the area within the red and blue lines &ndash; area that can get inundated &ndash; is already developed. The project first proposes to reduce the impact of indiscriminately built obstructions such as bridges, causeways, weirs, check dams etc. on flow of water in Pune&rsquo;s rivers by removing, streamlining, remodeling, or rebuilding them. The effect of such interventions will be to reduce the high flood level. This in turn will reduce the extent of area likely to get flooded by a 25 or 100 year flood. Another way of saying this is that the effect of these measures will help to bring the red and blue lines closer together.</p>
<p><strong>C. Create public realm along the river</strong></p>
<p>Building the embankments will also enable the creation of a continuous public realm along both banks of Pune&rsquo;s rivers. Having such a continuous public realm will ensure that unlike today, people will be able to move along the length of the river.</p>
<p><strong>D. Curb Pollution by Drainage and Sewage Treatment Works</strong></p>
<p>The project also proposes to curb the sewage flowing directly into the Pune Rivers by laying an interceptor sewer which will curb and divert the sewage to the nearest existing and proposed STPs along the river bank. As this project will span for longer time duration, thus, it becomes essential to plan for infrastructure services well in advance. The embankment so designed will house the interceptor sewer line curbing the sewage falling directly into the river.</p>
<p><strong>E. Enhance connectivity</strong></p>
<p>At present there is limited connectivity along and across the Pune&rsquo;s Rivers. There are far too few connections and there are long stretches where the river lacks connectivity across to the other side. The project thus proposes to strengthen the</p>
<p>existing street network by introducing bridges and access roads that will further enhance the connectivity to the river. Pedestrian and cycling routes will also be planned along the promenades of the riverfront.</p>
<p><strong>F. Integrate River in the life of the city</strong></p>
<p>Another objective of this project is to create a network of gardens, open spaces, public
    promenades that will preserve the natural environment and turn the Pune Rivers into an important
    asset for the city.</p>
<p>How will it be possible to undertake the work of building flood protection embankments when today various court rulings prohibit construction within the red and blue lines?</p>
<p>The Pune River Development Project proposes to make a comprehensive plan of works, the implementation of which will have the effect of modifying the red and blue lines to be within the proposed works. By proposing works in this sensitive manner (as shown in the diagram below), that fully respect the spirit and intentions of the court ruling the PMC is confident that its works will receive approvals not only from the courts but also from environmentalists interested in reversing the environmental degradation of Pune&rsquo;s rivers.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>How does the Pune Municipal Corporation plan to involve the public in the riverfront project?</strong></p>
<p>The Pune Municipal Corporation is interested in creating awareness and sensitivity about Pune River Development Project in Pune city. It has created an official webpage for this project which will ensure periodic information dissemination to citizens, thus, ensuring people participation since the very beginning of the project.</p>
<p>The PMC also intends to consult Pune&rsquo;s citizens and maintain transparency in what it intends to do. By taking such an approach it intends to also build popular support for the project.</p>
